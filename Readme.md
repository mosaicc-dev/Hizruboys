EcoSaathi

## 🚀 Project Description
EcoSaathi is a web platform that transforms waste into wealth for urban waste workers. It uses AI-powered waste recognition, smart verification, and real-time pricing to connect informal waste pickers with recyclers and businesses. By ensuring fair prices, reducing fraud, and promoting responsible recycling, EcoSaathi creates a circular economy that fights poverty while improving urban sanitation.
